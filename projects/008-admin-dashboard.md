## Admin Dashboard

### Project Description:
Students will create an admin dashboard that displays real-time data, such as sales and user statistics. This project will help consolidate Tailwind CSS design principles by implementing an effective user interface.

### Project Specifications

1. **Dashboard Layout**:
   - Design a main dashboard with a clear, modern layout using Tailwind CSS.
   - The dashboard should feature sections for overview, reports, and analytics.

2. **Statistics Display**:
   - Add sections displaying key metrics, such as total sales, active users, and new subscribers.
   - Organize data using Tailwind’s grid and flex utilities to maintain a clean and accessible layout.

3. **Tables and Data Representation**:
   - Include a table for presenting data such as recent transactions or recent sign-ups.
   - Use icons or placeholders styled with Tailwind to represent data visually (e.g., for graphs).

4. **Responsive Design**:
   - Ensure the dashboard layout is responsive, adapting seamlessly to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
   - Use Tailwind’s responsive utilities to style for mobile-first design.

5. **Accessibility and Usability**:
   - Choose accessible color schemes and readable typography.
   - Add labels and alt text where needed for improved accessibility.

6. **Customization and Personalization**:
   - Modify the Tailwind configuration file (`tailwind.config.js`) to add custom colors and typography that suit the dashboard’s theme.
   - Customize padding, margins, and spacing utilities for better layout control.
