# Color Palette Generator (DOM Navigation)

## Objective
Create a grid of color squares that allows users to explore different color combinations by generating new palettes.

## Description
- The page displays a grid of squares, each representing a color in a palette.
- Initially, each square is filled with a random color.
- Users can generate a new palette by clicking a "Generate Palette" button.
- Using DOM navigation, access and modify each square to change its color every time a new palette is generated.

## Practical Skills
- Use methods like `querySelectorAll` to select all palette squares.
- Access and modify individual squares using `childNodes` or `children`.
- Change the color of each square by iterating through the palette elements and updating them via the DOM.
