# Project: Simple Web Navigator

## Project Objective
The aim of this project is to build a simple browser-like interface that helps learners understand how a browser retrieves and displays web resources. This project will focus on creating a basic client that can send HTTP requests and display minimal information from the response, helping students grasp the flow of data in the client-server model.

## Project Requirements

- **HTTP Request Simulation**:
  - Simulate sending HTTP requests to a server to retrieve data.  
  - Display the essential components of the HTTP response, such as the status code, response headers, and a portion of the response body (like HTML content).

- **URL Input**:
  - A basic input field for entering a URL.
  - An "Open" button to initiate the request when a URL is entered.

- **Response Output**:
  - Display the response status code and brief response headers.
  - Show a snippet of the HTML response body (e.g., the title or meta tags of a webpage).

- **Instructions Section**:
  - Include a brief tutorial or visual representation in the interface to guide users on how HTTP requests and responses work.

## Suggested Enhancements

For learners who wish to take the project further:
- **Status Code Messages**:
  - Show a message based on common HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 for success, 404 for not found).
- **Request Headers**:
  - Allow users to add custom headers to their requests.
