# Project: Interactive Hangman Game

## Project Overview
In this project, you will create an interactive version of the classic Hangman game. Players will attempt to guess a hidden word letter by letter. Vite will be used as a module bundler to streamline development, manage resources, and optimize the final build for distribution.

### Project Objectives
- Learn how to set up and configure a project with Vite.
- Understand the basics of creating a simple, interactive game.
- Explore bundling, optimizing, and structuring JavaScript, CSS, and assets for an efficient workflow.

## Project Specifications

### 1. Initial Setup with Vite
- **Create Project**: Start a new project using Vite.
- **Install Dependencies**: Set up the initial file structure, and install necessary dependencies.
- **Vite Configuration**: Use Vite’s configuration to manage CSS, JavaScript, and assets in a modular and optimized way.

### 2. Game Structure
- **Display the Word**: Show the hidden word as a series of blank spaces (_ _ _), where each blank represents a letter.
- **Letter Input**: Allow users to input letters one at a time. Correct guesses reveal the letters in the word, while incorrect guesses are counted.
- **Error Counter**: Set a limit (e.g., 6 errors). Each incorrect guess increases the counter by 1, and a part of the hangman illustration appears. Upon reaching the limit, the game ends with a loss.

### 3. Interactive Features
- **Guess a Letter**: Players can enter letters one by one, and the game updates the display with correct letters or increases the error count for wrong guesses.
- **Used Letters Indicator**: Show the letters that have already been guessed to avoid repeats.
- **Win/Loss Messages**: At the end of the game, display a message indicating if the player has won or lost, with an option to start a new game.

### 4. Optimization and Build
- **Development Optimization**: Use Vite’s development server to see real-time changes during coding.
- **Production Build**: Create a production-ready build with Vite, optimizing for speed and file size.
