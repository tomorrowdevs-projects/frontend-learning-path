# Project: User Authentication & Profile Management System

## Project Overview
This project is designed to provide a hands-on experience in implementing user authentication and profile management within a web application. You will create a user authentication system with JWT and secure APIs using CORS and rate limiting.

### Key Features
1. **User Registration & Login**
   - User registration form with input validation.
   - Password hashing using bcrypt for secure storage.
   - Login system with error handling for invalid credentials.

2. **JWT Authentication**
   - Generate and validate JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user sessions.
   - Protect sensitive API routes, ensuring only authenticated users can access them.

3. **User Profile Management**
   - Provide a user profile page for viewing and updating information.
   - Allow users to update their password securely with identity verification.

4. **CORS & Rate Limiting**
   - Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to allow only specific domains.
   - Implement rate limiting to secure APIs against abuse.

5. **API Security**
   - Validate input data for security and consistency.
   - Implement a secure logout process and session management.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand and implement JWT-based authentication.
- Configure CORS for secure cross-origin requests.
- Apply security best practices for APIs, including rate limiting and input validation.
