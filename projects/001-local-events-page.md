### Project: Local Events Interactive Website

**Project Objective**  
The goal of this project is to create a static website that displays a list of local events. The website should have a responsive design, adapting properly to devices with different screen sizes. The site structure should include a navigation bar, an introductory section, a section to display the events, and a footer. The design should be visually appealing and easy to navigate, without the use of JavaScript.

**Project Requirements**  
**HTML**: The site structure should be semantic, using appropriate HTML elements to create a well-structured page. Proper definition of the header section, main events section, and footer will be required.

**CSS**: CSS selectors should be used to apply styles to specific elements. The site should be built around the box model, utilizing Flexbox and Grid layouts to position elements responsively.

**Responsive Design**: The site must adjust to different screen resolutions using media queries and relative units (such as %, em, rem, vh, vw) to ensure optimal display on devices of various sizes.

**Website Structure**  
**Navbar**: A navigation bar containing the site logo and main links. It should be visible and accessible on mobile devices as well.

**Hero Section**: A main section with a background image and text that welcomes users, aiming to attract attention to the website’s mission.

**Events Section**: A grid of events, each presenting key information like title, date, and category. Events should be displayed in a clear and easily readable format.

**Footer**: A section at the bottom of the page containing contact information or links to the site’s social media accounts or organization.

**Styling Suggestions**  
**Typography**: Use readable fonts and a good typographic hierarchy, ensuring that titles, subtitles, and body text are easily distinguishable.  
**Colors**: Choose a consistent color palette with appropriate contrasts to enhance readability and navigation.  
**Layout**: Organize the page to maintain a good balance of spaces, with a layout that is clear and comprehensible on both large and small screens.
