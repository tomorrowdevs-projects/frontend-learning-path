# Theme Selector for a Web Page (Event Handling)

## Objective
Implement a theme selector that allows users to change the page's background and text color.

## Description
- The page contains several buttons (e.g., "Light", "Dark", "Night", "Colorful"), each representing a theme.
- When a user clicks on a button, the page's theme changes (e.g., background color, text color).
- Each button has an event listener that changes the theme based on the selected option.

## Practical Skills
- Use `addEventListener` to handle button clicks.
- Change CSS classes on the `body` or specific elements to apply each theme.
- Use predefined CSS classes that correspond to the selectable themes, separating theme-changing logic from HTML structure.
