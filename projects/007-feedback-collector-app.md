# Project: Feedback Collector App

## Objective
Create a web application that allows users to submit feedback on various services or products. This project will cover the full cycle of UI/UX design and development, focusing on user-centered design, responsive layout, and accessibility.

## Specifications

### 1. Design Phase

- **Wireframing**:
  - Create a simple wireframe layout for the app using tools like Figma or Balsamiq.
  - Layout should include:
    - **Navigation bar**: Displaying the logo and main navigation links.
    - **Feedback form**: Fields for "Name", "Email", "Feedback message", and a submission button.
    - **Feedback list**: A section displaying submitted feedback with the name and message.

- **Prototyping**:
  - Build a clickable prototype with basic navigation to test the user flow.
  - Ensure all components are logically organized and easy to understand.

### 2. Coding Phase

- **HTML Structure**:
  - Use semantic elements such as `<header>`, `<main>`, `<form>`, and `<footer>`.
  - Define fields with appropriate labels and placeholder text.

- **CSS Styling**:
  - Use a consistent color scheme with good contrast for readability.
  - Apply a grid or flexbox layout to position elements.
  - Create reusable CSS components for buttons, form fields, and feedback entries.

- **Responsive Design**:
  - Ensure the app is fully responsive by using media queries and flexible units (e.g., `%`, `vw`, `vh`, `em`).
  - Test the app on different devices and orientations to verify its adaptability.

- **Accessibility**:
  - Add descriptive labels to form fields, ensuring screen readers can interpret them.
  - Use appropriate contrast for text and background colors.
  - Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard-accessible.

### 3. Iteration and Testing

- **User Testing**:
  - Conduct simple user tests on the prototype to gather feedback on usability.
  - Make any necessary adjustments to improve navigation and the user experience.

- **Code Refinement**:
  - Based on user feedback, refine layout, colors, and the positioning of elements.
  - Document changes and improvements made after the testing phase.
