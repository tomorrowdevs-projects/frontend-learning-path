# Interactive Quiz (Element Manipulation)

## Objective
Create an interactive quiz page where each question and answer is dynamically modifiable using DOM element manipulation.

## Description
- The page presents a series of multiple-choice questions on a specific topic (e.g., general knowledge, geography), each with three or four answer choices.
- Students must use `innerHTML`, `setAttribute`, and `classList` to update the page's content based on selected answers.
  - When a user selects an answer, the system shows whether the answer is correct or incorrect, dynamically changing the text and styling of the feedback message.
- The quiz does not need scoring logic but should use JavaScript only for manipulating each question and answer.

## Practical Skills
- Modify page content using `innerHTML` and `setAttribute`.
- Use `classList` to add and remove CSS classes to show visual feedback for correct or incorrect answers.
- Dynamically change attributes like `disabled` on answers to prevent multiple selections.
