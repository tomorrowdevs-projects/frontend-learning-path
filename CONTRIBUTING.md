# Contributing

Here are the contribution guidelines for the **TomorrowDevs** projects.

## Creating new projects
New projects must observe the following rules:

1. Every problem must have a README.md file explaining:
2. The problem itself
3. A reference for the student to some documentation that could help them solve the problem
4. Every problem must have one category.
5. Every problem README.md file must implement the [template file](README_TEMPLATE.md).

## Solving a problem
1. Solutions must be submitted by opening a pull request. The pull request must observe the following rules:
2. The branch name should be formatted as `solution/<problem-name>` for example: `solution/binary-search`
3. The solution must be placed inside of a folder using your name or username. Example: `micheleriva/solution.js` or `mitch/solution.js`
4. The solution file must be placed inside the "challenges" folder in the problem subdirectory. For example: `/programming-basics/binary-search/solutions/micheleriva/solution.js`
5. Every commit must adopt the conventional commits rules. Learn more [here](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
